# Foodie-App
Created a Food App that displays food items as well as let you add a food's name, description, calories, and a link to it's recipe. I also added a broadcast reciever that randomly selects a food item, with a toast displaying: "Happy Cooking: *Food Item*" I also have a video explaining my code as well an app test: (*App Test*) https://youtu.be/x5GJ8MRhsOs
